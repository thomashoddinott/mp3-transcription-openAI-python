 There's already lots of people who are spending hours and hours and hours a day talking to and interacting with their AI best friends, their AI lovers, etc. That's only going to get way more sophisticated. Absolutely. And I think those folks, I'm not excluding myself, who knows. I mean, I don't mean to other them. I think it's going to be very, very common. We're all going to get really emotionally attached to these AI characters that we interact with. And I think it's going to feel very natural to start talking about AI rights, comparing it to civil rights. And I'm quite concerned that if we go down that road, it could be very perilous. Because that affordance of those rights could go hand in hand with some of the worst dystopian outcomes that you describe in your book. Yeah, I completely agree. I mean, I think one of the major, major things about AI's that we will see is that it will be able to create intimate relationships with human beings. I don't necessarily mean sexual, could be also sexual, but intimate relationship. Oh, it'll be sexual. That's not all it'll be, but yeah, some. And it's very close. It's already beginning to happen. It will be a major issue in societies all over the world.
